# PROJECT'S README : ASIATIC OPTIONS PRICING

## OUR OBJECTIVE : 

    Our purpose is to modelling the price of an asiatic option. We seperate this projet in 3 parts :
        - Make the theoretical compute to demonstrate the BS Asian Option PDE
        - Implement Euler Explicit and Implicit
        - Compare to Monte Carlo Method

## FILES AVAILABLES : 
    - .pdf with theoretical calculus
    - src code .py 
    - the uses is explain in the .py , name variable are clear and understable.
